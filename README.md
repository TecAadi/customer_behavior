Data Analytics project showcasing customer behavior using python , SQL, power BI


# Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end data analytics workflow**, covering data ingestion, exploration, cleaning, querying, visualization, and presentation. The goal of the project is to transform raw data into meaningful insights that support data-driven decision-making.

The workflow begins with loading and analyzing the dataset in Python, followed by structured querying using PostgreSQL, interactive dashboard creation in Power BI, and finally summarizing insights through a professional presentation created with Gamma.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is provided in **CSV format** and contains structured records related to *[e.g., retail sales / customer transactions / business performance data]*. It includes multiple attributes such as dates, categories, numerical measures, and identifiers that enable trend analysis and performance evaluation.

The dataset is first loaded into Python for exploratory analysis and data preprocessing before being stored and queried in a PostgreSQL database.

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)** – Data loading, EDA, and data cleaning
* **PostgreSQL** – Running SQL queries and aggregations on cleaned data
* **Power BI** – Building interactive dashboards and visualizations
* **Gamma** – Creating the final presentation for stakeholders

---

## Project Workflow

### 1. Loading Data in Python

* Imported the CSV dataset using Pandas
* Inspected data structure, columns, and data types
* Verified dataset size and basic statistics

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyzed distributions of numerical variables
* Identified trends, outliers, and anomalies
* Explored relationships between key attributes using visualizations

### 3. Data Cleaning

* Handled missing and null values
* Removed duplicate records
* Corrected inconsistent data types and formats
* Prepared a clean dataset suitable for database storage and analysis

### 4. SQL Queries (PostgreSQL)

* Loaded cleaned data into a PostgreSQL database
* Executed SQL queries to:

  * Generate summary statistics
  * Perform aggregations and grouping
  * Extract business-relevant insights

### 5. Power BI Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize key insights. The dashboard includes:

* Trend analysis visuals (e.g., time-based performance)
* Category-wise or segment-wise comparisons
* KPI cards highlighting important metrics
* Filters and slicers for dynamic exploration

### 6. Analytical Report

A structured report was created summarizing:

* Objectives of the analysis
* Methodology and tools used
* Key insights derived from Python, SQL, and Power BI
* Business implications and recommendations

### 7. Presentation using Gamma

The final report was condensed into a **professional presentation** using Gamma, designed for non-technical stakeholders. The presentation focuses on:

* Problem statement
* Key findings
* Visual insights from dashboards
* Actionable recommendations

## Results & Insights

The analysis revealed several important insights such as:

* Significant trends and patterns in the data
* High-performing and underperforming segments
* Opportunities for optimization and improvement

These insights can be used to support better strategic planning, improve operational efficiency, and enhance overall decision-making.

---

## Source Code

The complete **source code** for this project is included and organized as follows:

* Python notebooks for EDA and data cleaning
* SQL scripts for database queries
* Power BI dashboard file
* Gamma presentation file

All files are well-documented to ensure clarity and reproducibility of the analysis.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine
2. Install required Python dependencies using:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Python notebook to perform EDA and data cleaning
4. Load the cleaned data into PostgreSQL and execute SQL queries
5. Open the Power BI file to explore the dashboard
6. Review the Gamma presentation for a summarized view of insights
